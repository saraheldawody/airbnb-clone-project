# 🏡 Airbnb Clone - Backend

This is the backend for an **Airbnb Clone**. It helps users sign up, list properties, book stays, pay online, and leave reviews. This project is not finished yet — we are still working on it.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

The goal is to build a strong backend system that supports:

- 👤 User accounts (signup, login, profile)
- 🏘️ Property listings (create, update, delete)
- 📅 Booking system (reserve homes, check-in/out)
- 💳 Payment system (make and track payments)
- 🌟 Reviews (users rate properties)
- ⚡ Fast and optimized performance

---

## 🛠 Project Features (Plan)

### 1. API Docs
- Uses **OpenAPI** to document all endpoints.
- Supports **REST API** with Django REST Framework.
- Supports **GraphQL** for flexible queries.

### 2. User Management
- Endpoints: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- Register, log in, update profile, delete account.

### 3. Property Management
- Endpoints: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- Add, edit, view, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System

### 5. Payments
- Endpoint: `/payments/`
- Process and record payments for bookings.

### 6. Reviews
- Endpoints: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- Post and manage user reviews on properties.

### 7. Performance
- Database indexing for faster access.
- Caching with Redis to reduce load.

## 🗄️ Database Design

This project needs a good database design to keep track of users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the main entities, their key fields, and how they are connected.

---

### 🧑 Users

Stores all users (guests and hosts).

- `id`: Unique ID
- `name`: Full name
- `email`: Email address
- `password`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: True if the user is a host

🧩 **Relationships**:
- A user **can create many properties** (if they are a host)
- A user **can make many bookings**
- A user **can write many reviews**

---

### 🏡 Properties

Stores property listings.

- `id`: Unique ID
- `host_id`: User who owns the property
- `title`: Name of the property
- `description`: Description of the property
- `location`: Address or city
- `price_per_night`: Cost per night

🧩 **Relationships**:
- A property **belongs to one user** (host)
- A property **can have many bookings**
- A property **can have many reviews**

---

### 📅 Bookings

Stores details of property bookings.

- `id`: Unique ID
- `user_id`: Who made the booking
- `property_id`: Which property was booked
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date
- `status`: e.g., confirmed, cancelled

🧩 **Relationships**:
- A booking **belongs to one user**
- A booking **belongs to one property**
- A booking **has one payment**

---

### 💳 Payments

Stores payment info for bookings.

- `id`: Unique ID
- `booking_id`: Related booking
- `amount`: Amount paid
- `payment_date`: When it was paid
- `status`: e.g., completed, pending

🧩 **Relationships**:
- A payment **belongs to one booking**

---

### ⭐ Reviews

Stores user reviews for properties.

- `id`: Unique ID
- `user_id`: Who wrote the review
- `property_id`: Which property the review is for
- `rating`: Number between 1–5
- `comment`: Written feedback

🧩 **Relationships**:
- A review **belongs to one user**
- A review **belongs to one property**

---


## 📌 API Endpoints Plan

### 🧑 Users

```shell
GET /users/ POST /users/ GET /users/{user_id}/ PUT /users/{user_id}/ DELETE /users/{user_id}/
```


### 🏠 Properties
```shell
GET /properties/ POST /properties/ GET /properties/{property_id}/ PUT /properties/{property_id}/ DELETE /properties/{property_id}/
```
### 📆 Bookings

```shell
GET /bookings/ POST /bookings/ GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/
```

### 💳 Payments
```shell

## 🔐 API Security

Security is very important for this project. The backend will include several features to protect user data, bookings, and payments.

---

### 🔑 Authentication

- We will use **Token-based authentication** (like JWT) to make sure only logged-in users can use protected features.
- Users will get a token after they log in. They must send this token with each request.

🔒 **Why it matters**: Protects user accounts and personal information from strangers.

---

### 👮 Authorization

- We will add rules to make sure users can only do actions they are allowed to do.
- For example:
  - A guest cannot delete another user’s booking.
  - Only the host who owns a property can edit or delete it.

🔒 **Why it matters**: Stops users from accessing or changing other users’ data.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

- We will add limits to how many times a user can call an API in a short time.
- This protects the server from abuse or spam.

🔒 **Why it matters**: Keeps the site running smoothly and prevents attacks.

---

### 🔐 Secure Payments

- We will connect with trusted payment services (like Stripe).
- We will **never store sensitive credit card information** in our system.

🔒 **Why it matters**: Protects users from fraud and keeps payment data safe.

---

### 🧼 Input Validation & Data Sanitization

- We will validate all user inputs and remove any harmful code (like scripts).
- This helps protect against attacks like SQL Injection or XSS.

🔒 **Why it matters**: Prevents hackers from sending harmful data to the system.

---


## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It means that whenever we make changes to the code, the system will automatically:

1. **Test the code** to check if it works correctly.
2. **Build the app** (like putting all the pieces together).
3. **Deploy the app** to a server if everything is okay.

This helps us **catch bugs early**, **save time**, and **deliver updates faster**.

### Why CI/CD is important

- 🚀 Automates testing and deployment
- 🛡️ Makes the app more stable and reliable
- 🧪 Helps catch errors before going live
- 🔄 Speeds up updates and improvements

### Tools We Might Use

- **GitHub Actions** – For automation workflows (testing, deployment)
- **Docker** – For consistent environments
- **Docker Hub** – For storing Docker images
- **Heroku**, **Render**, or **AWS EC2** – For hosting the app
