# 🏡 Airbnb Clone - Backend

This is the backend for an **Airbnb Clone**. It helps users sign up, list properties, book stays, pay online, and leave reviews. This project is not finished yet — we are still working on it.

## 🚀 Project Goal

The goal is to build a strong backend system that supports:

- 👤 User accounts (signup, login, profile)
- 🏘️ Property listings (create, update, delete)
- 📅 Booking system (reserve homes, check-in/out)
- 💳 Payment system (make and track payments)
- 🌟 Reviews (users rate properties)
- ⚡ Fast and optimized performance
